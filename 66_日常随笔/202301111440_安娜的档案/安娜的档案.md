> ​        Hi, I'm Anna. I created [Anna’s Archive](https://annas-archive.org/), to make shadow libraries more searchable and usable. Before that, I  started the Pirate Library Mirror, aimed at preserving important  collections. This is my personal blog, in which I and my teammates write about piracy, digital preservation, and more.
